# IOT-homa-based-health-monitor-connected-to-ThingSpeak-
The goal of this project is to provide a health monitor that is viewable to both healthcare provider and patient who are in different locations
Initially the project I made was to build a heart rate and temperature monitor using arduino only. However, I found out that the heart rate sensor did not like being interupted and was giving random readings. I then added the nodeMCU to separate the temperature sensor and added an LCD just for fun. I then connected it to Blynk this time.
